week 2 software frameworks


Instructions
Each folder contains the lecture notes, lecture video, laboratory exercises and other materials for that week. We would suggest that for each week, you first look through the laboratory exercises, then once you've understood what you need to produce for that week, read the lecture slides, watch the lecture video and work on your laboratory exercise at the same time. The lecture video may contain a partial demonstration of what you need to do for your laboratory exercise.

Laboratory exercises for one week are due at the start of next week's laboratory class. You must submit your solution in-person in your laboratory class. The submission process requires you to demonstrate your work and answer questions from your tutor.
